   *
   * Why: with the compiled-in default (80-bit, X87ReducedPrecision=0) every x87 op that FEXCore
   * cannot keep in a double goes out through the softfloat ABI thunks, and a device A/B on a
   * 32-bit D3D9 title measured those thunks at 20-50 % of ALL CPU, with frame rate roughly
   * doubling when the option was flipped. 32-bit code is where x87 still lives -- a 64-bit guest
   * uses SSE for scalar float -- so the trade is worth taking exactly here and the 64-bit/ARM64EC
   * module is untouched.
   *
   * The trade is real and is not a rounding detail: x87 intermediates become 53-bit instead of
   * 64-bit, so anything that genuinely depends on the extra mantissa bits (some geometry,
   * collision and physics kernels, a few reduction loops) can produce different results, and a
   * guest that compares its own float output against a recorded value can disagree. That is the
   * price of the frame rate, and it is why this is a DEFAULT rather than a hard-coded value.
   *
   * Exists() is the layered "did anyone actually ask for this" test: FEX::Config::LoadConfig and
   * ReloadMetaLayer have already run above, so the meta layer holds whatever the environment layer
   * picked up from FEX_X87REDUCEDPRECISION -- which is exactly what Documents/madeira-fex.txt
   * writes (ContentView.swift setenv("FEX_" + NAME)). So a user line X87REDUCEDPRECISION=0 still
   * wins, and so does the env var directly; only the absence of any override lands here. The same

   * `__wine_unix_call_dispatcher` target); no host instruction is ever fetched from them. Asking
   * for host execute permission here is not merely redundant, it is actively harmful, because of
   * what ntdll-unix does with such a request:
   *
   *   allocate_virtual_memory (virtual_ios.c:14467) translates the sub-4GiB zero_bits ceiling into
   *   this process's window (ios_wow_translate_limits, :14488), maps the page there, and then -
   *   because VPROT_EXEC is set - calls mprotect_range -> mprotect_exec (:14552, :8071).
   *   mprotect_exec finds that iOS/TXM will not grant exec (:8301-8318: it mprotects, re-queries
   *   via mach_vm_region and sees no VM_PROT_EXECUTE), runs a 64 MB BACKWARD MZ SCAN through guest
   *   memory looking for an owning PE image (:8417), decides the page is anonymous RWX (:8470),
   *   carves a 16 KiB JIT-pool slot (:8630), copies the page's bytes into it and `vm_remap`s the
   *   pool slot OVER the window VA with VM_FLAGS_FIXED|VM_FLAGS_OVERWRITE (:8694), then
   *   vm_protect()s it R+X (:8715) - i.e. read-execute, NOT writable.
   *
   * So the old request did not fail; it succeeded in the worst possible way. The page stayed
   * inside the window (so the window check below still passed) but its backing became
   * pool-remapped R+X memory - executable memory inside the guest window, which invariant 7
   * forbids outright - it burned a pool slot per 32-bit process, and the very next store
   * (`*Addr = 0x2ecd2ecd`) became a Mach-fault-emulated write through the anon-alias table.
   *
   * PAGE_READWRITE skips all of that: no VPROT_EXEC, so mprotect_exec is never reached, the page
   * is an ordinary readable/writable window page, the store is a plain store, and FEX's frontend
   * reads the opcode bytes directly.
   *
   * Executability is FEX's own bookkeeping, not the host page protection: the
   * HandleMemoryProtectionNotification(..., PAGE_EXECUTE) below inserts the range into
   * InvalidationTracker's XIntervals (InvalidationTracker.cpp:75), and QueryExecutableRange
   * (:435) - which is what WowSyscallHandler::QueryGuestExecutableRange and therefore FEXCore's
   * "is this guest range executable" check consult - answers purely from those intervals and
   * never calls NtQueryVirtualMemory. PAGE_EXECUTE is also not writable, so the range is X but
   * not RWX and no SMC trapping is armed for it. Nothing on wow64.dll's side inspects the page

/*
 * MADEIRA ml970: SELF IS NOT A HANDLE OPERATION.
 *
 * [srv-stats] on a 32-bit D3D9 title showed five wineserver request kinds
 * locked together at ~177/s each -- get_object_info=1770 dup_handle=1770
 * close_handle=1772 get_thread_context=1770 per 10 s, plus
 * set_thread_context=2950 -- which is 3 to 5 requests per rendered frame for
 * something no D3D9 game does. They are all ours: with G calls of
 * BTCpuGetContext and S of BTCpuSetContext the bodies below issue exactly
 * G+S object-info, G+S dup, G+S close, G+S get_thread_context and G+2S
 * set_thread_context requests, and G=590 S=1180 reproduces all five measured
 * numbers exactly.
 *
 * And the handle is always the same one. Every internal caller in
 * wine/dlls/wow64/syscall.c -- 32-bit exception dispatch, NtContinue,
 * NtSetContextThread, the APC and callback paths -- passes
 * GetCurrentThread(), i.e. the pseudo-handle, never a real thread handle:
 *
 *     pBTCpuGetContext( GetCurrentThread(), GetCurrentProcess(), NULL, &ctx );
 *
 * so the NtQueryObject / NtDuplicateObject / NtClose triple validates,
 * duplicates and closes a handle to the calling thread itself, three server
 * round trips to learn something the thread already knows. Worse, the
 * duplicate is what made the rest expensive: Wine's get_thread_wow64_context()
 * and set_thread_wow64_context() (dlls/ntdll/unix/signal_arm64.c) both open
 * with `BOOL self = (handle == GetCurrentThread());' and read or write the
 * caller's own CPU area with NO server call when that holds -- a duplicated
 * handle to the same thread does not compare equal, so every context transfer
 * took the cross-thread path through the server for nothing.
 *
 * So: when the target IS the current thread, skip the validation (a thread
 * always has full access to itself), skip the duplicate, and hand the
 * pseudo-handle straight down. Nothing else changes: a real handle -- which is
 * what a guest-issued GetThreadContext on another thread arrives as -- still
 * takes the original path, access check included.
 *
 * Expected: get_object_info, dup_handle and close_handle drop to ~0,
 * get_thread_info loses ~1770 per 10 s, and get_thread_context /
 * set_thread_context drop to ~0 as well because the self fast path above then
 * engages -- together ~1180 requests/s of the measured ~3700/s.
